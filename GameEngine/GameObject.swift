/// GameObject. A game object has a behaviour, mesh renderer and in the future a soundsource. All of the object's properties can be accessed from it's behaviour. Adopt the BehaviourProtocol to define custom behaviour. All properties are optional, because a object can play as an actor in a scene without having an apearance.
